## üìó Documentation

This template is designed to monitor an Object First OOTBI Cluster.

## Requirements

Zabbix version: 7.0 and higher.

## Tested versions

This template has been tested on Object First OOTBI 1.5.54.10104 (VSA).

## Setup

1. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/ObjectFirstCommunity/objectfirstcommunity-zabbix/releases/latest)
1. Create a user to monitor the service or use an existing user.
1. Create a host with the name of your cluster and link the `Object First OOTBI Cluster by HTTP` template to it.
1. Configure the following macros: {$OOTBI.API.URL}, {$OOTBI.CLUSTER.ID}, {$OOTBI.USER}, and {$OOTBI.PASSWORD} ([details](#macros-for-object-first-ootbi-cluster-by-http))

## Template: Object First OOTBI Cluster by HTTP
